Hi, I’m Robin. I am an MSc Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in AI and machine learning, particularly in their application to cognitive science and research-led problem solving. My work focuses on building practical tools for data analysis, automation and reproducibility using Python and related technologies.

My MSc project addressed a data variability problem in neurocognitive signals, exploring how machine learning models can be used to extract structure and meaning from noisy, high-dimensional data. 

I enjoy designing solutions that make life easier for users and teams, and I’m especially interested in DevOps, full‑stack engineering and cognitive science applications.
